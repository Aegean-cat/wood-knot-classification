# Wood Knot Classification using VGG16 (Transfer Learning + Fine-Tuning)

This repository contains the implementation of a wood surface defect classification model using a VGG16 backbone.  
The model classifies wood surfaces into **three classes**:
- **Good**
- **Live Knot**
- **Dead Knot**

This project is developed as part of **TME 6015 – Machine Learning Applications**, following all rubric requirements for code clarity, documentation, and reproducibility.

##  Business Context

Wood quality inspection is traditionally performed manually and suffers from inconsistency, visual fatigue, and labor cost.  
An automated image-based classification system can:

- Improve inspection consistency  
- Reduce manual workload and cost  
- Support downstream quality grading  
- Integrate into sawmill or reclaimed-wood processing pipelines  

This classifier acts as a **lightweight prototype** for automated wood surface inspection.
